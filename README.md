dynamic versus exhaustive
# Project 4

Problem description: You have started to play an online game which features customizable players. In this game, you start with some amount of “gold” which you may use to purchase armor items to protect your virtual player. First, you have allocated some budget of gold to acquire “armor” items, to increase the defensive strength of your player. There are many different types of armor items available to purchase from many different virtual shops and other players, with varying costs and benefits. For the sake of simplicity, we shall assume each armor item is “stackable”; you can purchase+wear multiple armor types and receive additional benefit. For example, if you purchase two different helmets of defensive strength +2 and +3, you would enjoy a total defensive strength of +5 (as opposed to the more common experience where only one helmet may be worn at a time). From the many virtual shops, you have a large list of various types of armor to purchase, and you have a budget, so you cannot buy everything you want. There are two algorithms to help you pick a subset of the available armor items, so that you can maximize your player’s defensive strength while staying within budget.

Solving: Using dynamic programming algorithm and Exhaustive algorithm to find the max defensive in limited gold.
